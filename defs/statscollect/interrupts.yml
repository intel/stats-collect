Total:
    title: "Total interrupts count"
    descr: >-
        The total number of interrupts and events that occurred during the measurement interval across
        all CPUs. This is calculated as the sum of all rows and columns in the '/proc/interrupts' file.
        Note that this number may exceed the total number of hardware interrupts, as it includes events
        like "RES" (rescheduling events) and "TLB" (TLB shutdown events), which are typically
        implemented with inter-processor interrupts and may be counted multiple times.
    scope: "system"
    patterns:
        - 'IRQ(\d+)'
Total_IRQ:
    title: "Total \"IRQ*\" interrupts count"
    descr: >-
        The number of interrupts serviced during the measurement interval. Only the interrupts that
        are referenced with an interrupt number in the '/proc/interrupts' file are counted. The
        "special" interrupts and events like "LOC" (local timer interrupts), "CAL" (inter-processor
        interrupts) or "RES" (rescheduling events) are not included in this count.
    scope: "system"
Total_XYZ:
    title: "Total \"named\" interrupts and events count"
    descr: >-
        The number of "named" interrupts and events that occurred during the measurement interval.
        Only the interrupts and events that are referenced with a name in the '/proc/interrupts'
        file are counted. For example, "LOC" (local timer interrupts), "CAL" (inter-processor
        interrupts), or "RES" (rescheduling events). The interrupts that are referenced with a
        number in the '/proc/interrupts' file are not included in this count.
    scope: "system"
IRQx:
    title: "IRQ{groups[0]} interrupts count"
    descr: >-
        The number of IRQ{groups[0]} interrupts serviced during the measurement interval.
    scope: "CPU"
    patterns:
        - 'IRQ(\d+)'
IRQx_rate:
    title: "IRQ{groups[0]} rate"
    descr: >-
        The average rate of IRQ{groups[0]} interrupts during the measurement interval.
    scope: "CPU"
    unit: "interrupts/sec"
    short_unit: "intr/s"
    patterns:
        - 'IRQ(\d+)_rate'
LOC:
    title: "Local timer interupts count"
    descr: >-
        The number of local timer interrupts serviced during the measurement interval. On modern x86
        Linux systems, these are usually TSC deadline timer interrupts.
    scope: "CPU"
LOC_rate:
    title: "Local timer interrupts rate"
    descr: >-
        The average rate of local timer interrupts during the measurement interval. On modern x86
        Linux systems, the TSC deadline timer feature of the local APIC is used as the local timer
        interrupt source. In the Linux '/proc/interrupts' file, these interrupts are referred to as
        "LOC".

    short_unit: "intr/s"
CAL:
    title: "Inter-processor interupts count"
    descr: >-
        The number of inter-processor interrupts serviced during the measurement interval. In the
        Linux '/proc/interrupts' file, these interrupts are referred to as "CAL", which comes from
        "remote function call".
    scope: "CPU"
CAL_rate:
    title: "Inter-processor interupts rate"
    descr: >-
        The average rate of inter-processor interrupts during the measurement interval. In the Linux
        '/proc/interrupts' file, these interrupts are referred to as "CAL".

RES:
    title: "Rescheduling events count"
    descr: >-
        The number of rescheduling events that occurred during the measurement interval. These events
        are triggered by the Linux kernel scheduler in various situations, such as task re-balancing
        or when a task is preempted by a higher-priority task. Rescheduling events are typically
        implemented with inter-processor interrupts. In the Linux '/proc/interrupts' file, these
        interrupts are referred to as "RES".
    scope: "CPU"
RES_rate:
    title: "Rescheduling events count"
    descr: >-
        The average rate of rescheduling events during the measurement interval. These events are
        triggered by the Linux kernel scheduler in various situations, such as task re-balancing or
        when a task is preempted by a higher-priority task. Rescheduling events are typically
        implemented with inter-processor interrupts. In the Linux '/proc/interrupts' file, these

TLB:
    title: "TLB shutdown events count"
    descr: >-
        The number of TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) shutdown events that occurred during the
        measurement interval. These events happen one CPU causes a TLB flush on other CPU, for
        example when viritual->physical address mapping of a shared mempry has to be changed. TLB
        shutdown events are typically implemented with inter-processor interrupts. In the Linux
        '/proc/interrupts' file, these interrupts are referred to as "TLB".
    scope: "CPU"
