Busy%:
    title: "Busy percent"
    descr: >-
        The percentage of time the CPU was actively executing instructions (C0 state) during the
        measurement interval, as opposed to being idle (C-state). This is also known as C0 state
        residency. Turbostat calculates it as "(delta MPERF / delta TSC) * 100%". "Delta MPERF"
        represents the number of cycles the CPU was in the C0 state, while "delta TSC" represents
        the total number of cycles during the measurement interval. Note that MPERF increments at a
        constant rate, which is the same or very close to the TSC rate.

    # This metric represents C0 residency, so categorized as a C-state.

Bzy_MHz:
    title: "Busy frequency"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency while in the C0 state (the state when the CPU is executing
        instructions, as opposed to being idle). Turbostat calculates it as "(delta APERF / delta
        MPERF) * 100%". Both "delta APERF" and "delta MPERF" represent the number of cycles the CPU
        was in the C0 state during the measurement interval. APERF increments at a variable rate
        that follows the CPU frequency (as CPU frequency increases, APERF increments faster), while
        MPERF increments at a constant rate, which is the same or very close to the TSC rate.

Avg_MHz:
    title: "Average frequency"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency, accounting for both idle and non-idle periods. Turbostat
        calculates it as "(delta APERF / delta TSC) * 100%". "Delta APERF" represents the number of
        cycles the CPU was in the C0 state during the measurement interval, while "delta TSC"
        represents the total number of cycles during the same interval. Note that APERF increments
        at a variable rate that follows the CPU frequency (i.e., as CPU frequency increases, APERF
        increments faster).

IRQ:
    title: "Interrupts"
    descr: >-
        The total number of interrupts and events that occurred during the measurement interval across
        all CPUs. This is calculated as the sum of all rows and columns in the '/proc/interrupts' file.
        Note that this number may exceed the total number of hardware interrupts, as it includes events
        like "RES" (rescheduling events) and "TLB" (TLB shutdown events), which are typically
        implemented with inter-processor interrupts and may be counted multiple times.
    type: "int"

SMI:
    title: "System management interrupts"
    descr: >-
        The number of system management interrupts (SMIs) handled by the system during the measurement
        interval. SMIs are typically triggered by the system firmware to address critical events such
        as thermal issues or power management tasks. When an SMI occurs, it "pauses" all CPUs and
        executes the SMI handler in the system firmware. From the OS perspective, an SMI is a
        blackout where CPUs stop executing OS code for a period of time (hopefully a short period).
        Frequent SMIs can indicate underlying problems. Turbostat reads this value from MSR 0x34
        (MSR_SMI_COUNT).
    type: "int"
    scope: "CPU"
    categories: ["Interrupts"]
IPC:
    title: "Instructions per cycle"
    descr: >-
        The number of instructions executed by the CPU per cycle. Turbostat calculates it as
        "Retired Instructions / delta APERF". "Retired Instructions" represents the number of
        instructions completed by the CPU during the measurement interval, obtained from PMU
        (Performance Monitoring Unit) counters using Linux "perf" events. "Delta APERF" is the
        number of cycles the CPU was active during the measurement interval. Note that APERF
        increments at a variable rate that follows the CPU frequency (i.e., as CPU frequency
        increases, APERF increments faster).
