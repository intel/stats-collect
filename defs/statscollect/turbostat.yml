Busy%:
    title: "Busy percent"
    descr: >-
        The proportion of time the CPU was busy executing instructions, as opposed to stying in an
        idle state (not executing instructions). In other words, this is the C0 state residency.
        Turbostat calculates it as (delta MPERF / delta TSC) * 100%.
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    # This metric represents C0 residency, so categorized as a C-state.

Bzy_MHz:
    title: "Busy frequency"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency in C0 state (C0 state is the state when the CPU executes
        instructions, as opposed to an idle state, where the CPU does not execute instructions).
        Turbostat calculates it as (delta APERF / delta MPERF) * 100%.

Avg_MHz:
    title: "Average frequency"

UncMHz:
    title: "Uncore frequency"
