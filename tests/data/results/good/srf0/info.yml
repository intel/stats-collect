      sorts of information about the SUT (e.g., 'dmesg', 'lspci -vvv' and 'dmidecode'
      output, and more). One snapshot of the SUT information is taken before the workload,
      and the other snapshot is taken after the workload. The second snapshot, however,
      includes only the information that could potentially change while the workload
      was running (e.g., 'dmesg' may include new messages).

    description: Periodically run 'ipmitool' to collect platform IPMI data, such as
      fans speed, CPU temperature, etc. The data are collected by running 'ipmitool'
      outside of the SUT (out of band), so that 'ipmitool' talks to SUT's BMC module
      via the network. This is supposedly better than running 'ipmitool' on the SUT
      (in-band), because it does not add to CPU load.
