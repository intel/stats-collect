      sorts of information about the SUT (e.g., 'dmesg', 'lspci -vvv' and 'dmidecode'
      output, and more). One snapshot of the SUT information is taken before the workload,
      and the other snapshot is taken after the workload. The second snapshot, however,
      includes only the information that could potentially change while the workload
      was running (e.g., 'dmesg' may include new messages).
