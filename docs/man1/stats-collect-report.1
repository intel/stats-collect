\f[B]-o\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R], \f[B]--outdir\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R]
Path to the directory to store the report at.
By default the report is stored in the
\[aq]stats-collect-report-<reportid>\[aq] sub-directory of the test
result directory.
If there are multiple test results, the report is stored in the current
directory.
The \[aq]<reportid>\[aq] is report ID of stats-collect test result.
.TP
\f[B]--reportids\f[R] \f[I]REPORTIDS\f[R]
Every input raw result comes with a report ID.
This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it
used in the HTML report to refer to the test result.
However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report IDs
just for the HTML report, and this is what the \[aq]--reportids\[aq]
option does.
Please, specify a comma-separated list of report IDs for every input raw
test result.
The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on.
Please, refer to the \[aq]--reportid\[aq] option description in the
\[aq]start\[aq] command for more information about the report ID.
.TP
\f[B]--copy-raw\f[R]
Copy raw test results to the output directory (unless the output
direcory is already part of the raw result sub-directory).
