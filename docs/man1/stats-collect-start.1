.SH Command \f[I]\[aq]start\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
Start collecting statistics.
.SS General options
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R]
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]-H\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R], \f[B]--host\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R]
Name of the host to run the command on.
.TP
\f[B]-U\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R], \f[B]--username\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R]
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH.
The default user name is \[aq]root\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-K\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R], \f[B]--priv-key\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R]
Path to the private SSH key that should be used for logging into the
remote host.
By default the key is automatically found from standard paths like
\[aq]\[ti]/.ssh\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-T\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R], \f[B]--timeout\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R]
SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.
.TP
\f[B]--cpunum\f[R] \f[I]CPUNUM\f[R]
If the executed command stresses a particular CPU number, you can
specify it via this option so that the number is saved in the test
result and later the \[aq]stats-collect report\[aq] command will take
this into account while generating the test report.
.TP
\f[B]--time-limit\f[R] \f[I]LIMIT\f[R]
The time limit for statistics collection, after which the collection
will stop if the command \[aq]cmd\[aq] (given as a positional argument)
has not finished executing.
.PP
\f[B]-o\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R], \f[B]--outdir\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]--reportid\f[R] \f[I]REPORTID\f[R]
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run.
By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host
name in case the \[aq]-H\[aq] option was used: [hostname-]YYYYMMDD.
For example, \[dq]20150323\[dq] is a report ID for a run made on March
23, 2015.
The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, \[aq]-\[aq],
\[aq].\[aq], \[aq],\[aq], \[aq]_\[aq], and \[aq]\[ti]\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]--stats\f[R] \f[I]STATS\f[R]
Comma-separated list of statistics to collect.
They are stored in the the \[dq]stats\[dq] sub-directory of the output
directory.
By default, only \[aq]turbostat, sysinfo\[aq] statistics are collected.
Use \[aq]all\[aq] to collect all possible statistics.
Use \[aq] --stats=\[dq]\[dq]\[aq] or \[aq]--stats=\[dq]none\[dq]\[aq] to
disable statistics collection.
If you know exactly what statistics you need, specify the
comma-separated list of statistics to collect.
For example, use \[aq]turbostat,acpower\[aq] if you need only turbostat
and AC power meter statistics.
You can also specify the statistics you do not want to be collected by
pre-pending the \[aq]!\[aq] symbol.
For example, \[aq]all,!turbostat\[aq] would mean: collect all the
statistics supported by the SUT, except for
.TP
\f[B]--list-stats\f[R]
Print information about the statistics \[aq]stats-collect\[aq] can
collect and exit.
.TP
\f[B]--stats-intervals\f[R] \f[I]STATS_INTERVALS\f[R]
The intervals for statistics.
Statistics collection is based on doing periodic snapshots of data.
For example, by default the \[aq]acpower\[aq] statistics collector reads
SUT power consumption for the last second every second, and
\[aq]turbostat\[aq] default interval is 5 seconds.
Use \[aq]acpower:5,turbostat:10\[aq] to increase the intervals to 5 and
10 seconds correspondingly.
Use the \[aq]--list-stats\[aq] to get the default interval values.
